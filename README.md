## Project brief:
In this Software Engineering workshop, our aim was to create an application that used a publicly available API, and create a unique application that solves a current problem. The other part of this workshop focused on the project-management side of Software Engineering, such as the Agile development method and other software management tools. Details of this process can be found inside 'SENG2021 - Group 12 Final Report.pdf', included in the root directory of the repository. 

## Project details:
RecipeSearch is a small, web-based app that uses publicly available APIs (specifically the Edamam API) to aggregate recipe data in order to make recipes, and cooking, more accessible for the average cook. Our group decided to tackle the problem of cooking - specifically lowering the barriers of entry that cooking currently presents. Specifically, we aimed to reduce the following barriers of entry that amateur cooks face:
- Finding new and exciting recipes that they have not been exposed to
- Using up the ingredients they currently have on hand; thereby reducing cost
- Providing an easy solution for meal planning and organisation


The app features a number of features aimed at making cooking (and finding recipes) an easier, more efficient experience:
- Searching by ingredient(s)
- Searching by recipe(s)
- Saving recipes
- Persistent tracking of ingredients the user has on hand
- Weekly meal planning

Through these features, we think we have done a good job of trying to cover the main barriers faced by amateur cooks when trying to cook at home, specifically budget, time and inspiration. 

### Tech stack:
The application is built on a HTML-CSS-Bootstrap-Jinja2 front-end, using Python with Flask for the back-end requests.

## How to use and run RecipeSearch:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that the Python version you are using is at least 3.6+. Development was done on Python 3.6.
3. Ensure that Python Flask and Flask Login are installed, and upgraded to the latest version.
4. Navigate to /Website/, and run 'Python3 run.py'. This should start up a Flask server.
5. Use the local address and port specified by Flask to use the application.

**This project has now been completed and closed, as of 25/5/18.**
